## Usage

To use `react-audio-play`, import the `AudioPlayer` component and provide the necessary props:

#### Keyboard shortcuts (When audio player focused)

They can be turned off by setting `hasKeyBindings` prop to `false`

| ‚Üí           | Forward |
| ‚Üë           | Volume up |

- `style` (object, optional): An object containing additional inline styles for the component.


## Advanced Usage

Starting with version `v1.0.4`, you can access certain actions of the `AudioPlayer` component programmatically using a `ref` with the following interface:

- `play`: Function to start audio playback.
- `pause`: Function to pause audio playback.
- `stop`: Function to stop the audio playback.
- `focus`: Function to focus on the audio player component.

## Example usage with ref (available from v1.0.4)

```js
import { useRef } from 'react';
import { AudioPlayer, AudioPlayerRef } from 'react-audio-play';

function App() {
  const playerRef = useRef<AudioPlayerRef>(null);

  const handlePlay = () => {
    playerRef.current?.play();
  };

  const handlePause = () => {
    playerRef.current?.pause();
  };

  const handleStop = () => {
    playerRef.current?.stop();
  };

  const handleFocus = () => {
    playerRef.current?.focus();
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <AudioPlayer ref={playerRef} src="path/to/audio.mp3" autoPlay />
      <button onClick={handlePlay}>Play</button>
      <button onClick={handlePause}>Pause</button>
      <button onClick={handleStop}>Stop</button>
      <button onClick={handleFocus}>Focus</button>
    </div>
  );
}

```

## Example with Custom Event Handling

```js
import React from 'react';
import { AudioPlayer } from 'react-audio-play';

const App = () => {
  const handlePlay = () => {
    console.log('Audio started playing');
  };

  const handlePause = () => {
    console.log('Audio paused');
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Audio Player</h1>
      <AudioPlayer src="path/to/audio.mp3" onPlay={handlePlay} onPause={handlePause} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

## Custom Styling

You can easily customize the appearance of the audio player by applying your CSS styles to the AudioPlayer component or by overriding the default styles in your project's CSS. Check
